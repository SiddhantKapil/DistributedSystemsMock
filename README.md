# RESTful APIs Demo

### About This Project

My motive behind this project is to build an easy-to-use demo for showcasing how RESTful APIs work. I followed a pure RESTful approach in designing this demo and I will keep updating it with other distributed systems features. I took PDA processor as an example problem and designed microservices to manage the PDA.

### Features Covered Till now

* Handling HTTP Requests using Golang
* Setting up localhost and listen on a port
* Call APIs using curl
* Caching the data
* Write Responses

### Features Yet to Be Covered
* Mobility and Replication for PDA processors on distributed systems
* Showcase difference between Asynchronous and Synchronous calls

### How To Use
* Run the server run 'server.sh'
* On a new terminal run 'client.sh'. Client will make all the API call and you can see the outputs.

I will be glad to hear from you if this helped you in any way. Feedbacks are welcome. Thank you.
